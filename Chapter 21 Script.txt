[[Upton Sinclair]]


[[Upton Sinclair]]:
In the fall of 1897, you entered Columbia University, where you spent three years as a special student, taking courses in [philosophy], history, literature, and music with such notable professors as Nicholas Murray Butler, James Harvey Robinson, George Edward Woodberry, and Edward MacDowell. While you were a student, you began to [write] puzzles, jokes, and captions for newspapers and magazines, earning enough money from this activity and the stories that followed to establish yourself in a rented room.

[philosophy]:
The object of criticism is materialism, not capitalism, and the mode of reform is personal purity, not collective political action. I have a dream that someday I will build up a tremendous force for the spreading of light by establishing a library of my own and others' books for the purpose of increasing helpful reading among the humble people of our land.

[write]:
For forty dollars a week, you wrote some ninety war-adventure stories for the publisher Street and Smith under the pseudonyms Lieutenant Frederick Garrison and Ensign Clarke Fitch. You married Meta Fuller, a young women who shares your vision over book composition.
You had a son and with a mere income of a poor book writer, your relationship ended up being unhappy.
But at this point you were introduced to [Leonard D. Abott].

[Leonard D. Abott]:
You are introduces to socialism. Inspired by the works of other such socialist who you met as a result of Abott, you decide to write a [novel].

[novel]:
The Jungle (1906) is without doubt one of the most widely read novels of the twentieth century and surely your chief claim on literary and social history. The novel is rooted ideologically in your increasing knowledge of and commitment to American socialism.
Its imaginative genesis was the unsuccessful [strike of Chicago meatpackers] in the summer of 1904, which led you to publish in the Appeal to Reason, the leading socialist publication of the day, a militant invitation to the slaughterhouse workers to join the Socialist party as the best way to achieve [political power] and ameliorate their material condition.


[strike of Chicago meatpackers]:
In 1904, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen's (AMC) attempt to unionize was foiled by the leaders' inability to join people of various ethnic groups into a unified group. To further complicate the union's problems, employers hired African Americans as strikebreakers, prompting social conflict and riots between black and white workers. The employers were right to assume that unions would have difficulty organizing across racial lines.
This proved problematic for many years to come.
The hardship workers endured throughout the Great Depression helped break down barriers between different ethnic groups and races, making union organizing more successful. In addition, the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 guaranteed workers the right to organize and bargain collectively and outlawed practices used by employers to discourage unionizing.

[political power]:
The stir created by the Jungle reaches all the way to the White House!
The president, Roosevelt, is shocked and consults with the Agricultural Department for the validity of your [facts].

[facts]:
The Agricultural Department reported that the meat was safe to eat and possessed no threat....
Roosevelt contacted your publisher, Frank Doubleday, who replied that his company had confirmed the facts.
Roosevelt then launched his own investigation and confirmed your facts to the [political scene].

[political scene]:
Congress at this time is considering a pure food and drug bill.
Roosevelt himself, in his 1905 message to Congress, had recommended action on the subject. However, conservative opposition to any regulation combined with opposition from drug and food-processing companies seemed likely to defeat the bill. The public outcry created by The Jungle changed the dynamic in Congress. The Senate approved the pure-food-and-drugs bill in late February by a vote of 63 to 4.
[Meanwhile]...

[Meanwhile]:
You are disappointed that your book produced only a few meatpacking regulatory laws.
You wanted to aim at the public's heat but instead aimed at their stomach!
Though the book failed to inspire people to be socialists, it did help you gain a lot of popularity and international prominence at the mere age of 28.
It will also be your [legacy].

[legacy]:
The modern Food and Drug Administration dates to the regulatory functions assigned to the Bureau of Chemistry of the Agriculture Department by the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. In 1938, Congress significantly expanded the regulatory functions of the 1906 law and extended FDA’s authority over processed foods. In 1990 Congress passed the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, which required food products, including processed meat, to provide basic nutritional information.

[[Ida Tarbell]]:
You were born on November 5th, 1857, in a small Pennslyvannia town. Your father worked at his own oil company, with a small group of close friends. An [event] that would haunt you for the rest of your life occured in your teens. Nonetheless, you proceeded forward to get a good [education] for woman in your time. 

[event]:
All was well in your father's business...until a shady company named the "South Improvement Company" came along. It was a front for standard oil -- and it bankrupted those like your father who refused to sell out by such illicit tactics as brokering deals with the local railroads to fix prices. In your eyes, John Rockefeller dipped his hands in not just her family's oil but in its blood. A family friend who worked with her father was driven to suicide.

[education]:
You graduated from high school with honors. She then went to Allegheny College, where she was the only woman in her class. Though she studied biology, it was here in college that she began to develop a passion for [writing].

[writing]:
You used to teach, but quit after realizing that your true interests lied in writing. You worked at a tiny magazine called The Chautauquan, eventually becoming editor. You accumulated enough cash in the position to eventually take time off to [study abroad]. 

[study abroad]:
While you attended in Paris, you continued to write freelance articles for American magazines. Soon, they came to the attention of an editor of a political and literary magazine with high readership called [McClure's]. 

[McClure's]:
You first published some timely biographies, that were very well-recieved. But your true legacy would be not in documenting what happened in the past, but what was happening in the present. Drawing on your own experiences, you began to write several installments on a [company] that destroyed your father's livelihood. 
[company]:
The company in question was Standard Oil, with John D. Rockefeller at its head. It was a danger to the country. Introduced to someone who used to work in Standard Oil by another [writer], you began a long interview process that went on as you published installment after installment in McClure's magazine. While the person you interviewed was a supporter of Standard Oil, he did not stop talking even after he realized that Standard Oil was being cast in a [negative light]. 

[writer]:
This writer was, interestingly enough, Mark Twain, who was the one who dubbed the term "gilded age" in the first place. 

[negative light]:
After you published the last installment of your report, the 19th, they were thrown together and published in the form of a book. Called The History of the Standard Oil Company, it influenced those as far as [Teddy Roosevelt].

[Teddy Roosevelt]:
As the horrors in The Jungle enlightened Teddy Roosevelt, so too did the practices described helped him. They were pivotal in his initiating the trust-busting of Standard Oil, which would finally be realized in 1911, when Standard Oil was broken up under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. You had some sembalance of justice served to the businesses and people the oil company preyed on. This was [your legacy].

[your legacy]:
You helped bring down one of the largest corporations in America. You also gave credence to the efficiacy of the muckraking movement, with words published in magazine leaping off the page to shatter a billionare. While you are female, you did not involve yourself much in the suffrage movement: in fact two other books you published, The Business of Being a Woman and The Ways of a Woman both asserted that woman only had a place in being at home. It is clear, however, that your life demonstrates that any individual, man, woman, rich, poor, can gain empowerment.

[[Florence Kelly]]: 
You were born in Pennslyvannia of Quaker and Unitarian parents coming from a strong [tradition] of shaking up the status quo. By no means impoverished, you and your father toured glass factories and witnessed the work of teenagers in horrifying conditions. Perhaps those memories shaped your views on [child labor]. At any rate, you recieved an [excellent education] that those laborers would never have.

[tradition]: 
Your father, David Kelley, was an abolitionist, involved in the founding of the Republican party, and served multiple terms in the House. Your great-aunt was also an abolitionist who made sure everyone escaped when the meeting hall she attended went up in flames. You fight for a different type of freedom, particularly against [child labor]. 

[excellent education]: 
You attended Cornell, a prestigious school even then, for six years. Though there were seperate classrooms for women, you still felt attracted to Cornell because of its promise of equal intellectual opportuniy for woman.  You graduated later than usual because of your sickly condition. Somewhat ironically, you ended up [marrying] a man studying mediciene. This man, however, you would meet while you were studying [abroad]. 

[abroad]: 
While you were abroad, studied at the University of Zurich (in Austria) and fell in love with [socialism] in Europe. The husband you would [marry] would be Polish-Russian, and you devoured Karl Marx's teachings wholly. You were so moved by the words of Eastern European socialists that you sought to bring them to England, publishing a translation of The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 so that English laborers could read it in English rather than German. 

[marry]:
Unfortunately, your marriage was not a happy one. You divorced him within three years. After suffering some abuse from your husband, you took your children, took back your maiden name, and ended up a resident of one of Jane Addam's recently-opened [settlement houses]. 

[settlement houses]:
In the settlement house, you lived as both a resident and a refugee. You work small-time for Jane Addams, finding work for other women at the house. With Chicago in an economic low, however, you must string together odd jobs until you catch a lucky [break]. 

[break]: 
You find employment in the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is paid by comission, for every hand-scrawled data sheet that you produce. Nevertheless, you take pride in your work. You tour factories, much as you used to do with your father. And the report you draw up is shocking, particularly in regards to [child labor]. 

[child labor]:
You write a report that finds while working for the Bureau of Labor in Chicago that kids as young as four and five are working in tenemant factories in apalling conditions. Prior to this time, discontent had been welling up towards factories that worked children for long hours in unhealthy environments. The report, of course, is not just on child labor. It has pages and pages of interviews that show employers paying their employees minimal wages and obfuscating and outright lying in their answers to a federal commitee investigating the matter. Outrage leads to the passing of the [Factory Inspection Act] before the year is out. 

[Factory Inspection Act]: 
This law was passed on a state level, not a federal one, but it was groundbreaking nonetheless. 

[socialism]: 

[federal level]: 

[legacy]:

[[Eugene Debs]]:
You are a high school drop out. At the age of 14, you left school and started working for Vandalia Railroad. You are a night fireman for the locomotive. Unhappy with your wages, you left to work at a local grocery house.

Meanwhile you joined the [Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen] and became and [active member].

You were also gaining popularity in your city. You served two terms as Terre Haute's city clerk and in the fall of 1884, you were elected to the Indiana General Assembly as a democrat for one term.

[Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen]:
A union for the benefit of railroad firemen and engineers.

Though at this time you were not employed in the [railroad industry], you were passionate and energetic which allowed you to get into the union. Everyone knew you would rise to the top of the union.

You were appointed as the editor of the BLF magazine. With your powerful journalist skills, you reached audience well beyond the BLF and made it the foremost labor voice of the time.

[railroad industry]:
At the time, the railroad unions were organized into seperate unions based on the proffession. This allowed the railroad industry to easily break strikes or replace those workers.

You were already frustrated with the BLF and so you decided to create your own unified union for the railroad industry. In 1893 in Chicago, you founded the [American Railway Union] (ARU).

[American Railway Union]:
The ARU is also known for the Pullman Strike.

The Pullman Strike was a failurea and you were sentenced to prison. In that prison, you realized that changes had to be made in the political and legal system for it to take effect in the union level.

[active member]:
After getting out of jail from you failed attempts of union striking, you convinced the American Railway Union to join the Brotherhood of Cooperative Commonwealth and found the [Socialist Party].

[Socialist Party]:
During these campaigns the Socialist Party put a number of issues on the national agenda and advanced perhaps by decades the legislation which achieved a number of objectives for working class America. The list includes giving [women the right to vote]. (Large numbers of your supporters were women). It includes legislation restricting child labor, and protecting workers' rights to join unions and when necessary to strike. It would also include workplace safety, on the railroads and in the mines and factories.

[women the right to vote]:
You were a firm advocate for women's right. This also helped you during the 1920 election, where majority of the women supported the socialists movement and for the first time were allowed to vote due to the passage of the 19th Amendment.

But yet, you recieved 919,000 votes. Slightly less than the 1912 election.

Maybe the reason is that you were [imprisoned] at this time and couldn't reach your audience very well.

Anyways, you got out of prison and recieved the Nobel Peace Price in 1924. The rest of your life, you spent trying to recover your health which was undermined during your time in prison.

You died due to heart failure in 1926 but left behind a powerful [legacy].

[imprisoned]:
The reason you are imprisoned is because you spoke against Wilson's policy. Your ideals have always been based on isolationism and anti-war.

In 1918, you made a speech in Ohio, urging resistance for the military draft for World War I.

You were arrested under the Espionage Act.

[legacy]:
You are seen as negative and positive at the same time. 

The negative aspects against you are that you failed to grasp the realities of the economy and politics at the time, you failed five times after campaining for presidency.

The positive aspects are a highly effective union leader highly effective union leader of turn-of-the-century America, a kind, big hearted and deeply loved man, respected even by prominent Terre Haute business men who chose to overlook his radical leanings. You are often cited as an example of the failure of our legal system to protect constitutional right of freedom of speech. In organized labor there is enduring respect for you as one of the giants among the pioneers of the American labor movement.

[[Jacob Riis]]:
You just arrived from Denmark to New York City. You are one amongst the many immigrants searching for a job and a prosperous lifestyle. You did get a job as a carpenter, but you weren't satisfied by it.

Your father always emphasized you to [learn] English and you became good at it by reading many novels. That skill might help you get a job.

You applied for several editor positions in various magazines but they didn't work out either.

[learn]:
You meet your telegraphy teacher from your previous school.

He said that the New York News Association is looking for a new trainee.

You immediately apply and get the job. You do your job well as the newspaper editor and get a decent salary. Unfortunately, the company is bankrupt again... You decide to buy the editorial company and after a few years, you sell it and make a hefty profit.

You then get a job as a police reporter at the New York Tribune. Your office was also really near to the foul core of the New York City slums. You always felt bad for the unforunate, and you thought that you had to make a [difference] for them.

[difference]:
Bringing about change was not easy.

You realized that you need support and legal backing to help the poor. But most of the middle class population don't even know about the living conditions of these people. You decided to write article after article on the [condition of these people].

It is hard to get the attention of the people. After all, there are so many other things going on that nobody really cares about these people. You thought, the only way to get the attention of the people is to actually show them how the other half lives. And so you decide to use the [new technology].

[condition of these people]:
As you travelled through settlement houses, you were shocked at the state of all the people.

The apartements were so small that barely one person could live comfortably, but there were about 15 people crunched into one.
The apartements had no light at all, and the people were living in actual filth.

[new technology]:
Photography would have been perfect, but the cameras are too slow and its almost impossible to take pictures in the dark.

However, you make a device that allows you to take pictures in the dark. You create a pistol like device that can be fired with cartridges and a bright light illuminates all around the apartements. Now, for the first time someone has [documentation] of the plight of the poor people.

[documentation]:
You decide to write a book and include all the photographs you took. The book is published as "How the other half lives" and gains popularity.

Now, for the first time ever, people knew how the poor immigrants lived and were shocked to see the state of tenenments.

You also met a new friend who shared the same [ideals and vision] as you do.

[ideals and vision]:
Theodore Roosevelt, the Commisioner of the New York police department, joint in on your adventures at night. 

He became a lifelong friend of yours and you both thought that in order to eradicate poverty, more [government action] was needed.

[government action]:
This idea influenced political action till present date.

The New York State Tenenment Act was modified under Roosevelt because of your political journalism.
Your contribution for spreading awareness about child labor also influenced the decison in 1910 to ban child labor.
The Smith-Huges act provided money to the state to improve public schools.
The Small part act of 1887 also demolished some of the slums in New York City.

Your efforts of spreading awareness about New York's water supply also saved New York from an epidemic of cholera.

Eventually, you [retire] in a small farm in Massachusetts.

[retire]:
You die on May 26, 1914.

But, your legacy still continues till today. The pictures you took still shocks many people and are still relevant in today's world. Also, your pioneering experience with photography opened a whole new field of flash photography, virtually revolutionized the way pictures and film are taken.
